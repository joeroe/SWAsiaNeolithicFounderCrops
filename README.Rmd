    analysis. It includes code to reproduce the figures and tables generated by 
    the analysis. 
    - [:file\_folder: analysis.html](/analysis/analysis.html): rendered version 
      of the supplement in HTML format.
    - [:file\_folder: analysis.pdf](/analysis/analysis.pdf): rendered version 
      of the supplement in PDF format.
  - [:file\_folder: data](/analysis/data): Data used in the analysis.
    - [:file\_folder: raw_data](/analysis/data/raw_data): Data from other sources â€“ 
      see manuscript for attribution.
    - [:file\_folder: derived_data](/analysis/data/derived_data): Collated and 
      processed dataset used for our analysis.

    generated in the analysis.

Additional R functions supporting the analysis are contained in the `R` directory.

## Run the compendium locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
itself and optionally [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[master.zip](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping:
- open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
- run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file).
- finally, open `analysis/analysis.Rmd` and 'knit' or run `rmarkdown::render("analysis/analysis.Rmd")` in the R console to produce the `analysis.html` and `analysis.pdf`.
