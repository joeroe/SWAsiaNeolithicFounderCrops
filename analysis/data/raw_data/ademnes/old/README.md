# ADEMNES data

The data in this directory was compiled by the University of Tübingen's
Archaeobotanical Database of Eastern Mediterranean and Near Eastern Sites
(ADEMNES, Riehl & Kümmel 2005), available at <https://ademnes.de>.

It includes:

* `ademnes_export_samples_flora.csv` – sample-level archaeobotanical data,
  exported via the ADEMNES web page on 9 September 2020. As of March 2021, this
  export function no longer works.
* `ademnes_site.csv` – site data, manually scraped from the ADEMNES web page on
  19 March 2021.

Missing coordinates for 'Al-Madam 1 - Thuqeibah' were added to `ademnes_site.csv`.
